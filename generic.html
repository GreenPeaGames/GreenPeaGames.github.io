							<p>Scrapyard is a physics-based, platformer fighting game. The game has a unique weapon selection mechanic that differentiates it from other similar fighting games: one player first picks a map to play on and then picks two weapons, from which their opponent gets the first choice. This means that players must always choose 2 weapons that they think will give a fun and fair game - otherwise their opponent can simply choose the stronger weapon.</p>
							<p>The weapon choice mechanics of Scrapyard allow for a greater variety of weapons types and strengths compared to other fighting games, because players must always choose a balanced matchup. This self-balancing effect means that less time is spent getting frustrated at overpowered weapons, and more time is spent trying new strategies and outplaying your opponents in a way that always feels fair. </p>
							<p>The game is still in the early stages of development, with updates coming soon. </p>
